Shivang Shah, Brittany Williams, and Valerie Kiki collaborated on a data analysis project using an Amazon Kindle dataset. The focus was to explore and uncover insights from key attributes such as Author, Star Ratings, Number of Reviews, Category Name, Price, Best Seller Status, and Sold By information. The team aimed to understand what factors may influence a Kindle bookâ€™s popularity and performance on the platform.

Through the analysis, the team uncovered that the Mystery, Thriller, and Suspense category showed strong potential for business focus due to consistently high engagement across pricing, reviews and star ratings. J.K. Rowling emerged as the most successful author in the dataset, supported by high review counts, competitive pricing, frequent best seller listings, and strong average ratings. Additionally, the analysis revealed that Amazon itself sold the majority of the books in the dataset, highlighting its dominant role in Kindle book distribution.

The insights gathered could be useful for independent authors, publishers, or marketers looking to better position Kindle books for visibility and success on Amazon.
